## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

- I'm confused about the section that states 'use the call or apply function to preserve 'this'. The readings about 'this' form the night before were informative, but the concept is hard for me to grasp.

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

- I can't think of any nagging questions. My biggest problem when problem solving is where to start.

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

- I certainly feel that I am making progress as a developer. I also feel that this progress for me, is a little slow. I'm having a hard time retaining information. I feel like there is so much, and a great deal of it isn't "sticking".
When I read, and follow along in class, I feel as though I understand, but when it comes time to apply this knowledge, I feel almost as if I don't know anything! I certainly feel as though I can do more to expedite my learning process, and intend to do so. I also feel like I am burning myself out a bit. I think that I am trying to force an understanding of the information, and get a bit discouraged when asked a question that I should know the answer to, but am unable to recall. I do feel good about pull requests now. That was a challenge for me at first. I think that the repetition of doing it and now having a little confidence in myself, is huge for me. It may not be much, but I do consider it progress, and intend to build on that, and hopefully keep that momentum going.
